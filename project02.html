              <h1>Finding fuel market share drivers for an Oil and Gas giant</h1>
							<section>
								<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
								<p>Over my 2.5 years experience at Accenture, I have worked as a data scientist in analytics consulting, specifically in the Retail-Consumer field. One of my projects was with an Indian Oil and Gas giant in a strategic data-driven project. The client was facing the issue of fuel market share loss at its Retail sites located on an extremely important highway, contributing to 40% of the business. This problem was highly interesting because of its innovative angle involving an understanding of market, strategy, and statistics to identify why customers (long distance truckers) were not visiting their retails sites, leading to loss, despite them being established leaders.

							<h2>APPROACH</h2>
  						<p>After data gathering, I noticed that we had limited sales volume and infrastructure data. The initial set of insights were also expectedly limited. Next, I worked with the client to design a data template to collect information about each retail site’s (client and competitors) characteristics like location convenience, maintenance, services rating (parking, smooth entry, service station, etc.), dealer financial strength, avg fuel pricing, complaints, distance from other sites, etc. </p>

									<div class="col-04"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/project2_3.png" alt="" /></span></div>
								</div>
							</div>

							<p>After deeply exploring the data, I developed a statistical segmentation model which divided the sites into groups sharing the most similarity. This helped the client understand the market scenario where they could see how client sites were faring against the competition in each group. Then, I developed a regression model in each group to identify significant factors impacting the market share. For e.g., in one group I saw that the client’s increasing fuel price above competitors was negatively impacting market share. In another group, I saw that having too many client’s own sites nearby was leading to a ‘cannibalization’ effect. Or that being an isolated site would lead to loss even if it ranked very high on services rating.</p>
							<p>Many such more insights were effective in developing not only short-term but long-term strategic actions as well. </p>
							<br>
							<br>

							<h2>INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD</h2>
							<p> To facilitate better understanding of the statistical solutions for the client, I developed an interactive dashboard on QlikView.</p>
