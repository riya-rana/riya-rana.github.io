              <h1>Splash: News App design</h1>
							<section>
								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>Daily Splash is a global media organization focused on creating, collecting and distributing high-quality news and information, and includes newspapers and digital businesses.
									The Splash delivered modest overall revenue growth during the year. The largest drag on revenue and earnings is a decline in digital advertising. The Splash is also facing incredible competition for readers time and attention and advertising dollars.
								</p>

								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
									<ul>
										<li><b>Task </b>: Propose and design a mobile app that provides readers with personalized news while providing opportunities for The Splash to do advertising for revenue. It should also be an engaging service which can grow its audience. </li>
										<li><b>Company/Client </b>: 5-day workshop session with a dummy client called ‘The Daily Splash’. Part of a 2-week training on Clients, software cycle understanding at Accenture, Chicago (USA)</li>
										<li><b>UX Methods Used </b>: Brainstorm, Personas, Paper Prototype, Heuristic Evaluation, Client input</li>
										<li><b>Tools Used </b>: Marvelapp</li>
										<li><b>Team </b>: 5 members. As we were all novices, we divided and brainstormed on all tasks equally</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
								</div>
								<br>
								<br>

								<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE USERS</h2>
								<p> We held interviews with the dummy client to gather their requirements and understand their users better. On that basis, we created 2 user personas: Ann and Chris </p>

								<div class="box alt">
									<div class="row gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-04"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/project1_user_ann.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										<div class="col-04"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/project1_user_chris.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>
								</div>
								<br>
								<br>

								<p>We notice how the app would need to serve two different kinds of users. The interviews helped us see how Personalization can come via using the user’s hobbies and interests. </p>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
										<ul>
											<li>Ann could find features like “related news” (for in-depth reading), “bookmarking” (for re-reading to patients), “notifications” (for breaking news), “comments” (for greater engagement), “share” helpful</li>
											<li>Chris could find features like “search” (as a search engine), “short descriptions” (for fast reading), “notifications” (for updates), “bookmarking” (for reading later) helpful</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</div>
									<br>
									<br>


								<h2>BRAINSTORMING</h2>
								<p>Our main focus was to brainstorm ideas that meet the user needs of personalization in an innovative way, and fulfill the business requirements of advertising opportunities as well. </p>
								<div class="box alt">
									<div class="row gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-04"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/project1_brainstorming.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>
								</div>
								<p> Overall, the Mobile App for The Daily Splash has been designed to cater to specific user needs to create an enjoyable, personalized and interactive experience- for both the casual and serious readers. The unique selling points of the App are outlined below:</p>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
									<ul>
										<li><b>Locally user-engaging and advertising opportunity:</b>  The App has a <b>‘near you’</b> feature, in which the user will receive push notifications based on their geographical location (advertisements can also be built into this feature in the future, e.g. a local theatre may pay The Splash to send in App ‘near you’ notifications to users in the area).</li>
										<li><b>Personalization on the home-screen:</b> News is split into <b>sections on the landing page</b>, so that users can choose which section they wish to read. Sections would include the main home-page news, 2-3 personalized sections news based on interests, and a final ‘near you’ collection.</li>
										<li><b>Personal topics:</b> The App will provide users with the option of <b> bookmarking articles </b> they are interested in (and to tag these bookmarks by ‘topics’), and to also receive push notifications for these articles.</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
								</div>
								<br>
								<br>


								<h2>LOW FIDELITY PROTOTYPE</h2>
								<div class="box alt">
									<div class="row gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-04"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/project1_lowfidelity_prototype_1.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>
								</div>
								<p> We made a few more design decisions for the home page: Have 4-5 main articles on 1 screen as these are the most important stories. Have 5 tabs so that user can easily check news between his/her different areas of interests. Rest of the 4 tabs will look similar to the Home Page. Article should have certain key points in bigger font. Different tabs of interest can be specified or be algorithm defined </p>

								<div class="box alt">
									<div class="row gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-04"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/project1_lowfidelity_prototype_2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										<div class="col-04"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/project1_lowfidelity_prototype_3.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>
								</div>
								<p> Users can interact with the App through comment and polling sections at the end of articles.
									Users can also search for articles if they want to explore by a specific topic, or they can also click on links within articles they are reading (for example, they can click on related articles, or the article may reference another article from the past and a link will be provided to this past article).
									The use of pictures and videos will be included for each article, to create a more enjoyable experience.</p>

								<div class="box alt">
									<div class="row gtr-uniform">
										<div class="col-04"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/project1_lowfidelity_prototype_4.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										<div class="col-04"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/project1_lowfidelity_prototype_5.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									</div>
								</div>
								<br>
								<br>


								<h2>IMPROVEMENTS</h2>
								<p> After an initial review with the client and supervisors, we noticed some areas for improvement:</p>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-12 col-12-medium">
									<ul>
										<li>A ‘sign in using Facebook/Google’ could be extremely helpful for personalization. User preference information from these third-party websites can feed in to Daily Splash App to target push notifications more accurately, and with creation of Personalization categories. </li>
										<li>An option to allow Target notifications only when the user is using the App. For e.g. Ann likes to check her the Daily Splash App several times a day. She is usually busy with patients during the day, so when she comes back and checks her phone, having a bunch of notifications from Daily Splash may be annoying (have to swipe out of them etc.) If the push notifications are targeted towards when she is actually using the App, she may be more likely to click in to the notifications, particularly if they are relevant. </li>
										<li> Advertisements can also be included through use of images at end of articles, providing the opportunity for revenue gathering.</li>
										</ul>
